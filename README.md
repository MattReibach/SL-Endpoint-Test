# SL-Endpoint-Test
A simple app to test SocketLabs Notification API and Inbound Parse API HTTP endpoints.  More information about creating your endpoint can be found in SocketLabs' [API Documentation](http://www.socketlabs.com/api-reference/).

##Description##
This app is built on GitHub's [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) which allows you to build desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The basic app was bootstrapped using the [Electron Quick Start Tutorial](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/).  The app also utilizes [Photon](http://photonkit.com/) which is a nice CSS library that allows you to easily style Electron apps to look like native OSX applications.

##Usage##
Download or clone the repository, then open a command line or terminal and navigate to the repository folder.  Install the required dependencies with the `npm install` command.  Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using the `npm start` or alternately `electron .` in the command line.
